# Task Assignment Review - Three-Tier Model System

## Overview
This document summarizes the three-tier model selection system that optimizes API usage based on task complexity and reasoning requirements:
- **Easy tasks** (immediate execution, simple) → **NVIDIA Small** (Llama-8b-instruct)
- **Reasoning tasks** (thinking, decision-making, context selection) → **NVIDIA Medium** (Qwen-3-next-80b-a3b-thinking)

### 2. **Reasoning vs. Processing Separation**
- **Before**: Mixed reasoning and processing tasks
- **After**: Clear separation - Qwen for reasoning, NVIDIA Large for processing
- **Reason**: Qwen excels at thinking, NVIDIA Large excels at content processing

### 3. **Flexible Summarization** (`utils/service/summarizer.py`)
- **Before**: Fixed model selection for summarization
- **After**: Dynamic model selection based on context length (>1500 chars → NVIDIA Large)
- **Reason**: Better handling of long context with appropriate model

### 4. **Search Operations Optimization** (`routes/search.py`)

- **Reason**: Better handling of long content and complex analysis

### 5. **Memory Operations Enhancement** (`memo/`)
- **Before**: Mixed model usage for memory operations
- **After**: Consistent use of Qwen for reasoning-based memory tasks
- **Reason**: Better reasoning capabilities for context selection and enhancement

## Enhanced Model Selection Logic

- Length: > 120 words or > 4000 context words
- Content: "comprehensive", "detailed", or "research" in question

# Hard/long context tasks (NVIDIA Large)
- Keywords: "analyze", "explain", "compare", "evaluate", "summarize", "extract", "classify", "identify", "describe", "discuss", "synthesis", "consolidate", "process", "generate", "create", "develop", "build", "construct"
- Length: > 50 words or > 1500 context words
- Content: "synthesis", "generate", or "create" in question

# Reasoning tasks (NVIDIA Medium - Qwen)

```

### **Flexible Summarization Logic**
```python
# Dynamic model selection for summarization
if len(text) > 1500:
    use_nvidia_large()  # Better for long context
else:
    use_nvidia_small()  # Cost-effective for short text
```
